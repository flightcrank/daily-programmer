(Intermediate): Novel Compression, pt. 2: Compressing the Data

Welcome to Part 2 of this week's Theme Week. Today we are (predictably) doing the opposite of Monday's challenge. We will be taking uncompressed data, running it through a compression algorithm, and printing compressed data. The grammar and format is exactly the same as last time.

You are still advised to write your program in a way that can be easily adapted and extended later on. A challenge later this week will involve putting all of your work together into a fully featured program!
Formal Inputs and Outputs
Input Description

The input will simply be uncompressed textual data. At the end, an EOF symbol is printed (note: in Windows an EOF is entered using Ctrl-Z on the console, and in Linux an EOF is entered using Ctrl-D at a terminal - or alternatively pipe a file containing the input using cat.)
Data Format

Same rules as before[2] . All words must go into a dictionary (just a list of words.)

    If a lower-case word (eg. stanley) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by a space.

    If a capitalised word (first letter is upper-case, eg. Stanley) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by a caret (^), followed by a space.

    If an upper-case word (eg. Stanley) is encountered, print its index in the dictionary, followed by an exclamation point (!), followed by a space.

    If the previous and next words encountered are joined by a hyphen rather than a space (eg. hunter-gatherer), print a hyphen (-), followed by a space (eg. 44 - 47).

    If word is followed by any of the following symbols: . , ? ! ; :, print that symbol after it, followed by another space (eg. 44 !).

    If a new line is encountered, print the letter R, followed by a space.

    If the end of the input has been reached, print the letter E, followed by a space.

Note: All words will be in the Latin alphabet.

Now for an important bit. If you encounter any of the following:

    A word is capitalised in any other different way than above,

    A word is not alphabetical (eg. has numbers in it),

    A symbol not in . , ? ! ; : is encountered,

    Two or more symbols are next to each other like ??1),

Then you must print an error message and then stop, because our simple basic compression format cannot account for these cases. Normally a practical compression system would handle it more gracefully, but this is just a challenge after all so just drop them.
Example Data

Therefore, if our input is given as:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Or, did it?

Then the output data is:

11
the
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
lazy
dog
or
did
it
0^ 1 2 3 4 5 0 6 7 . R 8^ , 9 10 ? E

Output Description

Print the resultant data from your compression algorithm, using the rules described above.
Challenge
Challenge Input

I would not, could not, in the rain.
Not in the dark. Not on a train.
Not in a car. Not in a tree.
I do not like them, Sam, you see.
Not in a house. Not in a box.
Not with a mouse. Not with a fox.
I will not eat them here or there.
I do not like them anywhere!

Example Challenge Output

Your output may vary slightly depending on how you populate your word dictionary.
